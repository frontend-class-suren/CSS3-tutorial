    <h1> All about Programming Languages</h1>

    <div class="Computer">

    <p>Computer programming can as well be defined as a process that leads from an original formulation of a computer problem to execute problems. Computer programming is also referred to as programming. It encompasses other activities such as understanding, analysis and generally solving problems that result in algorithm, verifying the algorithm requirements and coding algorithm in a target program language. The program also involves the implementation of the build system and managing derived artifacts like computer programs machine codes. Most often, the algorithm is represented in human-parseable languages such as Java, Python, Smalltalk among others. <br><br>

        The Purpose of Computer programming: <br> <br>
        <ul>
       <li>Programming is more fun and  astonishingly useful as it build your creativity and creates new career doors for those passionate about it. Most people today don't really know how a computer works even thou they can simply turn on a computer or a mobile phone by just clicking on some buttons or swiping a finger or two and the computer does what they want. Learning how to write computer programs will require one to understand how a computer works. <br><br></li>
        
      <li>Computer programming servers the purpose of finding a sequence of instructions that are able to automate the performance of specific tasks or solve defined problems.</li> <br>
        
        <li>Programming process therefore requires expertise in a variety of other subjects such as the knowledge of application domains, formal logic and specified algorithms.</li> <br>
        
        <li>Computer programming is usually regarded as one phase in a software development process within software engineering.
